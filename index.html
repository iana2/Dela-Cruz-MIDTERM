        <p>Cloud automation is the implementation of tools and processes that reduce or eliminate the manual work that is associated with provisioning, configuring and managing cloud environments.

            Cloud automation tools run on top of virtual environments and can be leveraged in public and private clouds, as well as hybrid and multicloud environments. In fact, automation is often used to standardize processes and policies across complex IT environments.
            
            Cloud automation plays an important role in enabling organizations to take greater advantage of cloud computing’s benefits, like the ability to use cloud resources on demand. It is also a vital component of efficient DevOps workflows.</p>
